## Implementation Notes

To implement scraping for these sources:

1. Each source requires custom HTML parsing based on its structure
2. Many sites may have JavaScript-rendered content (consider using Selenium or Playwright)
3. Some sites may have APIs available
4. Always respect robots.txt and rate limiting
5. Consider using caching to reduce server load
6. Handle errors gracefully when sites are unavailable

## Current Implementation

The `scrapers.py` file currently includes:
- `scrape_brooklyn_paper_events()` - Sample implementation
- `scrape_brooklyn_library_events()` - Sample implementation
- `scrape_eventbrite_music()` - Sample implementation
- `scrape_wagmag_art()` - Sample implementation

These functions return sample data and should be expanded with actual HTML parsing logic.
